<h2>About Me</h2>
<pr>I'm a 21 year old person from Brooklyn, New York studying English at the University of New Haven in West Haven, CT (stupid, I know). I like reading, writing, watching movies, making movies, listening to music, making music, and a bunch of other stuff. I don't know what to write about myself ever in these kinds of things. I think I want to be an English professor but also just a Bohemian novelist, poet, and musician, but honestly, I have no idea what's going on in my life. Therefore, I've used things I like to fill-in my lack of explanation of myself and I guess you can make your own assumptions about who I am based on my preferences. I've organized things above based on category so have a look. My writing is there too in case you want to see it but it's okay if you don't want to.
<br>
<br>	
Anyway, have a nice day, friend.
<br>
<br>	
	Love you,
<br>
