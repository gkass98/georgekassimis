<h3>On the Jagged Sidewalk of W 17th St.</h3>
	
<pr>On a wet, blue, and frustrated summer day, an effervescent man puts one foot in front of the other and repeats this motion to simulate walking. Upon entering the park, dozens of upright specimens push their way past him, as his stroll aggravates their natural neighborhood trot. Passing the muted green sign which reads UNION SQUARE, a detuned piano whispers a convoluted jazz riff while a group of Mahayana Buddhists chant sermons in various pitches. The metallic statue of Gandhi glimmers in the noon day sun and, with feelings of dread and existential insignificance, a bearded man scrapes his arm on the jagged sidewalk of W 17th St.
<br>
<br>
	It is here that the effervescent man, dressed in his snake-skin leather shoes, brown wool suit, and 19th century bowler hat, sets up shop. Upon a patch of overgrown grass, near cardboard residences sheltered by hydrangea bushes, he lays his worn briefcase. After wiping his perspiring forehead with a silk handkerchief, the locks click, and the top drops upon the grass, indenting the weeds beneath it. From this sarcophagus, he exhumes a plaid picnic blanket stained with mustard and regurgitated hot dog sap. Grabbing two corners, he whips the fabric in the air, gently laying it on the spoiled lawn. Despite its sporadic holes which allow conspiring blades to penetrate, the blanket has become the effervescent man's altar, the place where his offerings to the god of the "quick buck" have all occurred.
<br>
<br>
      Upon this chantry, the effervescent man places three items: a Poland Spring bottle filled with an indigo liquid, an aging vinyl copy of Bobby Sherman's Here Comes Bobby, and a rubber severed hand purchased at the bourgeois department store known as Spirit Halloween. After mumbling a Hail Mary and taking off his shoes, the effervescent man begins his pitch.      
<br>
<br>
     "Ladies and gentlemen, step right up! Behold the magic in which I intend to pursue! Fellow New Yorkers, New Jersians, oblivious tourists, gather 'round, gather 'round!"
<br>
<br>
      Catching the ear of a few headphone-less citizens, a marginal crowd fixes their attention upon the effervescent man, who's snow-white hair and bushy mustache draw them closer.
<br>
<br>
      "Ah, yes! Hello! As you can plainly see, upon this priestly blanket, I have placed three items that have been clinically proven to cure headaches!
<br>
<br>
Insomnia!
<br>
<br>
Heart disease!
<br>
<br>
Cancer!
<br>
<br>
The mumps!
<br>
<br>

General dissatisfaction with the high speed,

extroverted, superficial society we

inhabit today!
<br>
<br>
Acne!
<br>
<br>


And for you more intimate gentlemen with low, uh, 'energy', dare I say? Ha ha, yes, my dear lads and lassies, listen here!"
<br>
<br>

      At this point in time, the marginal crowd begins to fill in, the Mahayana Buddhists cease their chanting, and the bearded man stops his scraping. With all eyes on him, the effervescent man picks up the rubber hand and continues:
<br>
<br>

      "As you can see here folks, this is fake. Why, imagine if it were real? Wouldn't that be quite the gag! But no, you sharp apes, there is no fooling you! True, this may be a rubber hand, but, combined with the objects below, this rubber hand becomes an instrumental element in my three-step cure all treatment! Imagine, a movie prop able to cure sickness! Blasphemy, you must surely think, but after years of study in the eastern sections of Paris, Texas and Delhi, California, I can assure you, the antidote for life has finally arrived!"
<br>
<br>

      Various grunts of disbelief fluctuate throughout the crowd. Despite their skepticism, the effervescent man remains confident, keeping his back straight and rubbing his protruding paunch with an orange, varicose hand. To the left of the gathering, a man wielding an Aloha Pineapple Jamba Juice casts a passing glance at the occurrence. Catching his glimpse, the effervescent man reaches out and guides him to the altar, using the sweat-stained handkerchief to wipe the oozing smoothie from the man's lips. Awkwardly, the man stands there, licking his newly salted saline lips while the effervescent man rambles on:
<br>
<br>
      "Ah, yes, young sir, don't be shy, don't be shy. I must ask you, do you suffer from any ailments? Weakness of the knees? General exhaustion? The occasional kidney stones?"
<br>
<br>
      "Sure," the man admits.
<br>
<br>
      "Great! GREAT! A perfect subject for my three-step treatment! I am like you, in a way. I suffer from the worst disease of all: overwhelming antipathy toward all humans. But, my good man, I have found the cure! For you, and for me! So please, sit right here. Yes, right there. Exquisite!"
<br>
<br>
      "Will this really work?"
<br>
<br>
      "Why, of course! Of course! How could you ever doubt someone with a bushy mustache, aye?"
<br>
<br>
      "It's so fuzzy..."
<br>
<br>
      "Yes, of course! You are quite the observer! Anyway, let us begin. First, I shall take this hand and try to.... 'give you a hand' with that illness! Ha, ha! Aren't I funny?"
<br>
<br>
      "Whatever you say,'" the man replies.
<br>
<br>
      With this, the effervescent man rubs the hand all over his subject's body while the crowd gazes in religious interest.
<br>
<br>
     Staring into the salesman's eyes, the subject begins to cry as words pour from his mouth:
<br>
<br>
      "Oh dear, doctor. I feel it! My lord, as God as my witness I do declare, your treatment is working!"
<br>
<br>
      "Ha ha, yes! I'm truly satisfied with the sincerity of your words. You sir, are a man of science! Now, take this bottle and drink up! It will surely rid you of general dissatisfaction!"
<br>
<br>
      The subject picks up the Poland Spring bottle containing the indigo liquid and consumes all 16.9 ounces of it. In spiritual relief, he approaches nirvana.
<br>
<br>
      "My God! I can feel the energy flow through my veins! All truths are coming to me! I feel anew!"
<br>
<br>
      "Great sir! You flatter me, so! Truly, this is a moment of wonder! As the last step, I'd like you to take this record here and listen to it. Bobby's words will speak to you and align your subconscious. Then, I assure you, you will experience perfect clarity and for the rest of your life, no illness shall ever disturb you."
<br>
<br>
      "Whatever you say, mister. I shall listen to you forever! You have cured my weak, fragile mind! You have cured my putrefying body! You have changed everything I know, and I put my faith in you! I praise you and thank you for everythi---"
<br>
<br>
      The effervescent man hits the subject on the head with a large, jagged rock, killing him instantly. He calmly places the three items back in his briefcase, wraps the body in his priestly blanket, puts his snake-skin shoes back on, and drags the corpse with him.
<br>
<br>
      The crowd stares blankly at the Jamba Juice cup left by the subject. Someone picks it up and sucks out the remaining smoothie. The upright specimens then resume their customary neighborhood trot, while a detuned piano whispers a convoluted jazz riff, the group of Mahayana Buddhists resume their chants, Gandhi glimmers in the sun,and, on a wet, blue, frustrated summer day, a bearded man scrapes his arm on the jagged sidewalk of W 17th St.

<h3>In Mourning</h3>
<pr>It was an early October morning, and everything was gray and passive. I walked down the road, a cigarette between my lips. The wind hummed in my ear, while leaves crunched beneath my boots. Besides an occasional car, a distant shout, and the path I strolled on, which appeared older than the colonial homes of the far-off village, there were no indicators of civilization, or any of its malfeasance. It was like this every year. The road curved near a hill, plummeting into a mass of trees, which were painted blurbs of yellow and orange. Upon entering the forest, the crooning of the wind ceased as a haunting silence set in, chilling every bone, and every cell, in my body.
<br>
<br>
The road stretched about a mile deep into the woods, and the further I delved, the more uneasy I felt. The path began to fade away, its recognizable form obscured by collections of fallen leaves and branches. With its passing, the ominous silence grew into gentle whispers, which seemed as embedded in the forest as a babbling brook or an omnipresent owl. It was as if a thousand voices floated in the air, each one more desperate than the last. Some groaned, some moaned, some shrieked, but none formed words coherent to an articulate mind. Regardless of their foreign tongue, their songs resembled elegies, evoking within me a memory bound to my consciousness. One unwilling to fade into the general mass of forgotten reality. One which infected the branches of my neurons and entrenched itself further with each attempt of its exorcism. A memory, which remained with tyrannical sovereignty, of my late Annie.
<br>
<br>
Years before, we lived in perfect harmony. Every morning, I would awake to the simplicity of her features and relish their calming sensation; reflecting on the shadows which were cast upon her face by the minute rays of sun which penetrated the white blinds. Upon hearing her deep breath and the shuffling of the sheets, which routinely signified her waking, I would hide my face beneath the blanket, pretending to be asleep while she came to. Knowing my tricks, she would rip the cloak from my body, place her hands on my shoulders, and shake my torso, stating that, "those who sleep in will someday find themselves unable to wake." With this, I would attempt to rise, yet act as if I was unable to, moaning, being that my lips were paralyzed. This immediately brought her joy, as the once quiet room echoed with her soft laughter. Upon hearing her, I knew for once, in all my life, that I, the flannel-faced, moody reject, was loved.
<br>
<br>
The news of the accident came with the chiming of the phone. I was home, skimming through old books, magazines, letters, and TV channels to cool the transparent heat lit by our mutual frustration. Earlier, an argument, based on no substance but pure dissatisfaction, had drawn my Annie away from me. She needed to calm herself, clear her head. With this I agreed, as the mere sight of her simple features only caused the fire within me to burn brighter and burrow deeper. She decided to visit the pet store, as one of her deepest satisfactions was to watch pythons and lizards nestle in their artificial terrain. How she shrieked with glee as their tongues would pop out of the dirt to further comprehend their bearings.
<br>
<br>
I lied there, baring witness to the reveal of a recent breakthrough in medical science transmitted as pixels upon the glowing screen in front of me. A mustachio-looking man wearing wrinkled scrubs and translucent gloves floated across the stage. He spoke through his Botox smile, his teeth a collection of bronzed stalactites. As the camera zoomed in, his surreptitious countenance filled the display, the lens gazing into eyes unsettling, which were emerald irises that lacked pupils. The circular universe of green that rested upon the bloodshot sclera raised the hairs on the back of my neck, as his voice penetrated.
<br>
<br>
"In mourning, we find ourselves missing the presence of our deceased. We miss their touch. Their skin. Their hair. Their lips. It has been a treacherous ordeal for thousands of years...until now."
<br>
<br>
His words flooded through my veins like a dose of heroin newly injected and just reaching my lower half. As I stared into his eyes, I felt as if I was being stripped naked, made vulnerable in every possible way. Somehow, however, I did not feel shame, nor fear. Instead, a sense of contentment overcame me. A feeling of safety while fully exposed, similar to the comfort one feels while lying naked besides a lover.
<br>
<br>
The ring interrupted his sermon and I gazed at the phone which rested beside me. I shifted my weight to the left and stretched my arm to lift the receiver as the blanket cloaked around me dropped to the floor. The echoed voice on the line mumbled words that dissipated the heat coursing through me.
<br>
<br>
"We're sorry, sir...we couldn't save her...we tried everything we could..."
<br>
<br>
And even so, as the voice on the line almost whispered now, I could not help but focus on the man on the screen. The doctor continued.
<br>
<br>
"No more shall we visit stones to reflect and reminisce. No more shall roses decay upon grass watered by tears. No more shall we imagine the state of rot our loved ones exist in..."
<br>
<br>
The illusion of contentment had known me for too long and finally tired of my existence, ultimately departing with the click of the receiver. I began to shake and noticed the rain tapping on the window, its rhythm syncing with the pounding of my heart. My bones felt brittle and my knees gave way. A spilled puddle of wine mixed with the drops from my eyes wet my skin as I buried my face into the carpet. She had swerved to avoid a dog bleeding in the street, which licked the pavement to further comprehend its bearings. The railing gave way to the force of the bumper and the car tumbled down the ridge. Completing its roll, it plummeted into the Jahonse, where it sank to the bottom of the fifty-five-foot deep river. A faulty seatbelt locked her in place, and I imagined my Annie sitting there, terror and panic palpitating her heart as the water rose and filled her lungs with its current of finality. I, too, was drowning as the chiming of the NBC bells ringed through my ears and brought my attention back to the shaman in scrubs who spoke with a newly-inferred empathy.
<br>
<br>
"Today, I give you the chance to embrace. I give you the chance to gaze into eyes not in memory or photograph, but in flesh. I give you the chance not to simply remember, but to feel...present."
<br>
<br>
Deeper, the trees lost their muted color, becoming silhouettes of their existence. Their shadows overlooked my careful step as their crowns blocked the rays of moonlight. Darkness began to consume and confuse me, as my steps became more careful with each passing footfall. The only guiding light I had was the tip of my cigarette, its orange glimmers reflecting off my boots and the dirt beneath them. To no avail, my sense of sanity drained as the blackness thickened, the tobacco lantern becoming more and more impractical. A shuffle in the shrubs to my left and a distant whistle hurried me forward, my feet dodging the clawing hands attempting to pull me deeper into madness.
<br>
<br>
As I rounded a corner and approached the weathered fence, a flickering gaslight shone upon me. Its base, a rusted iron pole with chipping paint, resembled a decaying statue of Plato or Marcus Aurelius, paying homage to genius that once was but now succumbs to the adversity and convictions of time. Near this lamp, a faded wooden sign bounced in the wind as it hung by a single nail between the spandrels of the frame. As the gate creaked with my entrance, the entire structure shuttered, its bones rattling not just by my opening, but by a possum chewing its wedged hind leg off. As I shut the gate, the sign dropped from its peg and landed before me. The painted letters, diluted from rain and age, read: C M ERY.
<br>
<br>
It has been eight years since I lost my Annie to the river. Yet, in retrospect, she never truly left. She lives within the confides of my mind, the lining of my organs, the pulses in my nerves. But the subconscious awareness of her presence was never truly enough. Her simple features, though once calming, developed into haunting expressions of schizophrenic hallucination. The torturous image of her flooded skull skewered the memory of her blissful countenance, omitting dreams for nightmares. After failed attempts of her memory's riddance, inspiring flirtations with lobotomy and suicide, the recollection of the prime-time doctor occurred, and, instinctively, I found his number and called, thus beginning the journey I have made every year since.
<br>
<br>
Here I was again, maintaining a calm yet aware stature. There were few trees left to haunt me as I continued down the decayed trail. The lack of allowed the lucid crescent floating in the clouds to cast its reflected beams upon me, emphasizing my shadow, as well as the many others poking and protruding my silhouette. The invasiveness of these forms has become a routine occurrence, yet time has not diluted their suffocating effect. With each step, the air became thinner and thinner, and my breath began to resemble a pant. I could not help but feel their desire to consume my flesh, attempting anything to fill the emptiness residing inside. I kept my head down, watching the rise and fall of both boots as momentum drove me forward, trying to keep pace with the rapid pumping of my heart. As my chest tightened, and the blood ceased to flow into my extremities, the shadows grew numerous, almost as if they were closing in, ready to pounce at any given moment. As I gained pace, almost sprinting, I noticed the shadowed figures raise their arms and the mob suddenly sprung. I collapsed to the floor, tripping over fear and mediocrity, shouting to release the ghosts in my lungs. Yet, as the reverberation of my voice caused a flock to flee, the air remained still, and the shadows disappeared. Unperturbed, a crow, perched upon the shoulder of my Annie, stood tall and mocked the scream in its own rattling way and pecked at Annie's neck, pulling the polyester stuffing from a hole below her jaw.
<br>
<br>
Unlike most, this field of death and grievance isn't scattered with stone monuments etched with the names of the rotting corpses beneath them. Instead, as the doctor states, the individuals we lose are not meant to decay with the rest of the world. We suffer enough by relying on images and objects to remind us of their life, never truly providing that sense of presence that we yearn for year after year. To solve this grievance of humanity, the doctor, who still maintains that Botox smile he wore on screen, devised an alternative. Instead of locking our deceased in boxes of wood buried beneath the earth, we should instead erect monuments of the flesh, replacing the rot of the internal body with polyester and therefore create a taxidermicidol of those we've lost. And as I stared at the crow, plucking away at Annie's neck, I could not help but notice Annie's eyes staring right back.
<br>
<br>
Her gaze infected me, quivered my insides as my palms dampened with sweat. For what felt like months, I continued to watch her, trying to decipher how plastic irises could maintain a gaze for so long. I concluded their position was simply coincidental, their focus fixed in the very spot upon which I had fallen. Accepting this brief relief, I began to stand up, wiping the dust from my sweater as a frozen gust of wind meant for December carried the dirt to the heavens. I gathered myself, trembling as I slowly buttoned the cardigan, when I heard a faint sound in the distance, a gentle moan carried in the wind. I gazed over the hill, toward the path I originated from, and the tone ceased. I noticed the silence around me, each figure maintaining its stiff posture. I looked at Annie once more, her eyes fixed upon the ground, and I took a deep breath, studying her face and reminisced over the life we shared so long ago.
<br>
<br>
Proceeding down the road, near the fence with the fallen sign, the moan returned, accompanied by a choir of similar tonality. For a while, it remained in the distance, blending with the whistle of the wind and the shuffling of leaves. But as I continued, it grew louder, reaching out from amongst the grass and slowly crawled up my spine. By this time, all I want is to run, retreat to my life of minor acquaintances and awkward encounters, dreaming of the nestle of sheets that has remained comfortably lonesome for years. But as I tried to move, the moaning became an orchestra and its vibrations held me in place, buckling my knees with its song. And as I slowly turned, fixing my gaze behind me, the source of the moaning finally revealed itself: each figure was turned toward me, millions of eyes probing my sanity, and the moaning grew with the struggling movement of their mouths.
<br>
<br>
I broke free from the audible grasp, sprinting in fear from the field. The sweat poured down my back as my eyes watered with the wind. The trees grew and shrunk in my peripherals as I rushed down the road. Shadows danced amongst the forest and stripped me of logic and reason. The blood curdled within me, leaving my legs and arms numb with terror. The darkness chased me from behind, carrying its tune along with it. The music became extremely loud and burst my eardrums, the blood trickling down and mixing with my tears. The schizophrenic voices returned, and I was about to collapse when I noticed a light amongst the trunks. I hurried toward it and slammed into the door, finally falling upon the wooden floor within.
<br>
<br>
I cradled myself upon the floor, the sobs releasing involuntarily as I shook and trembled, when I finally blacked out.
<br>
<br>
"And that's how I got here," I murmured, nuzzled beneath a wool quilt, sipping the coffee given to me.
<br>
<br>
"My, my. You've suffered a great deal. I can't imagine the pain and fear you must've felt."
<br>
<br>
The doctor had found me on the floor, propped against his door, unable to speak or move. He was able to lie me on his couch and let me rest for what he claimed was five hours. He had been nothing but hospitable.
<br>
<br>
"It was terrible, doctor. Everything seemed to be collapsing around me. All I wanted was to see her again, just like I do every year. But the eyes! They were so sad and desperate! And they kept staring! Not just Annie, but everyone there! It was as if they noticed me and were trying...trying to..."
<br>
<br>
"Trying to what?"
<br>
<br>
"Trying to say something! I heard moaning and what sounded like mumbled words! It felt as if they were trying to speak to me, to warnme."
<br>
<br>
The doctor shuffled in his seat at the sound of the word. The whistling wind knocked on the windows and interrupted what he was going to say. A door behind him creaked open, which he excused as a result of the draft.
<br>
<br>
"I understand your fear. Being in your state, one cannot help but give in to the trickeries of the mind. But you must know that it is simply hallucination. You see, in mourning, and in times of stress, the mind resorts to flights of imagination. These moments create images and feelings that are meant to ease the pain of absolute reality. It is quite remarkable, in a way. The mind wants to preserve life and therefore resorts to imagination to ease the process of emotional turmoil. Sometimes, however, these images drip into our conscious interpretation of reality, and appear, well, real."
<br>
<br>
"I see what you mean, doctor. I really do. I just miss her so much. All I can think of is the last time I saw her. Well, the last time I saw her alive. We had a fight, did you know that? She felt like I wasn't present. She told me that all I did was shut down and isolate myself from her. And you know what I did? I didn't address the problem, I didn't tell her I would change. I called her a bitch. That was the last thing I said to her. Not I love you. Not I'm sorry. I said maybe if you weren't such a bitch and actually listened, I'd say more.
<br>
<br>
The doctor watched as I spoke, maintaining his empathetic expression, the same expression that drew me in when I first saw him on screen. The wind suddenly grew stronger outside and the door behind him slowly creaked more ajar. I noticed what appeared to be scratch marks on the floor within the room it concealed and a somewhat surgical neatness to the furniture beyond it. An uneasiness grew within me when the sudden dinging of the oven announced the completion of the roasted chicken the doctor was preparing.
<br>
<br>
"And that's dinner," he announced, stealing my gaze away from the room.
<br>
<br>
"Why don't you go to the bathroom, just over there to the left, and wash up. I'll have everything ready when you get out."
<br>
<br>
With that, I stood up and walked toward the back of the one floor cabin this supposed marvel of medicine resided in. I found it peculiar that a man of such stature would find himself living in a run-down house such as this, far away from any potential clients. He was celebrated years ago and people found his ideas, if somewhat controversial, quite mesmerizing and progressive.
<br>
<br>
I found my way to the bathroom, which contained a simple white porcelain toilet and matching sink. I splashed water on my face and washed any remaining dirt from my hands and fingernails. After drying them off, I stepped out of the bathroom and saw that the doctor was still busy preparing the meal. So, without making any noise, I snuck into the room that I found myself drawn to earlier.
<br>
<br>
I cannot explain to you in a coherent way what I found upon entering, but I will thus forth attempt. The floor was littered with scratch marks from wall to wall. The furniture consisted of a steel table, placed compulsively within the room's center. Stains of dried and wet blood blotched the surface as strands of hair hung from the edges. In a corner, various surgical tools were collected in a bucket, each freshly soaked in crimson. Near the bucket, there lay a cigarette-stained mattress with yellowing sheets upon it. A young girl, not even twelve, was nestled upon it, her face covered in mucus and tears. Her lifeless body was spread across the blankets and her head rested upon the blood-soaked pillow. Across her chest, a thin, clean incision began at the bottom of her throat and continued to the top of her pelvis. Opened, the wound contained a mix of blood, tissue, and polyester. As I approached her, she began to tremble and her eyes began to blink. As she saw me, she screamed in fear and shouted, help, help. I tried to console her and told her I would get her out. But as I drew near, I noticed her eyes lay not upon me, but behind. And as I turned around, the Botox smile grew large and wide and with a comforting tone, the doctor said:
<br>
<br>
"Don't worry, this is all just imagination."
<br>
<br>
It's an early October morning, and everything is gray and passive. The wind is humming in my ear as it makes its way throughout the field. The visitors follow the road and plummet into the painted blurbs of orange and yellow, leaving civilization, and all of its malfeasance, behind them. They stare and pray before us, hoping our souls are doing well amongst the clouds. As they pass, each one of them sick with grief, we moan and stare to get their attention. Distracted by their suffering, they never look up and simply make their way back up the path which curves near a hill. It's like this every year. We scream and cry, but our mouths do not move. Our insides, once rich with blood and life, have been replaced with polyester, only our hearts spared the substitute. And though we suffer, our moans turning into symphonies every night as crows pluck at our necks, I am contempt to state that I was erected next to my love, our hands sewn together by the Botox smiling doctor. And as we shriek together, I recall the trips I made years ago to evoke within me a memory. One unwilling to fade into the general mass of forgotten reality. One which infected the branches of my neurons and entrenched itself further with each attempt of its exorcism. A memory, which now is a pleasant reality, of my late Annie.

<h3>I Assume Responsibility for New York</h3>

<pr>
On the sun of rocks and rivers
<br>
<br>
I was able to illuminate the stars of my past
<br>
<br>
and throw them into myself.
<br>
<br>
On this brink of illuminations,
<br>
<br>
I slipped into a trance,
<br>
<br>
while you were away, picking garden roses
<br>
<br>
for our lonely table
<br>
<br>
On a wave of flowing waters,
<br>
<br>
I skipped rocks.
<br>
<br>
But here was a man unknown.
<br>
<br>
A man indescribably happy.
<br>
<br>
And I found the purest water.
<br>
<br>
nothing fresher nor pure as this.
<br>
<br>
And I became a prisoner, set free
<br>
<br>
continuously.
<br>
<br>
I arrived to the edge
<br>
<br>
This bridge an old, sinking web,
<br>
<br>
trapping sounds of saxophones
<br>
<br>
to the east arose palisades where
<br>
<br>
sunsets changed.
<br>
<br>
And I arrived loud and green
<br>
<br>
bursting through piles of hats and veils from
<br>
<br>
war widows
<br>
<br>
And I thought I knew you from a dream....
<br>
<br>
Noiselessly, the world has begun to defect
